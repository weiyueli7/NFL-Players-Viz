# Data Cleaning

### Introduction

This directory contains `clean.py` that cleaned the original datasets. Specifically, it first cleaned the players data from  `players.json` and then merge the  `states.csv` from the [web](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv) for the latitudes and longitudes.

### Deployment

In your terminal, change to this directory and run the command below:

```python
python3 clean.py
```
